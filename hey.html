Hey, um... Sorry this is a buggy mess. It's supposed to replace the stylesheet when you click your name.
There's no guarantee it won't replace it with the same stylesheet, though, making it appear like it did nothing.
Occasionally, it'll also disable all the stylesheets. I dunno why. I suck at code.

Aaaaaaanyway...

I'm sending you on a treasure hunt thing. At first I'll just kinda blatantly tell you what do do, like with the "And whenever you're done, view page source."
But later, you'll hopefully develop an intuition on how to do these things. If you get really stuck 'cause of my shitty puzzle-making skills, you can ask me for hints. >.>
Along the way, I'll be sprinkling in ilus 'cause that's what I do.

Anyway, your first hint thing is "there's more source here than just this HTML document"

<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" title="main" href="pink.css" />

    <link rel="alternate stylesheet" type="text/css" title="yellow" href="yellow.css" />

      var colors = ['blue','yellow','green','purple'];

      function changeStyle() {
      var lnks = document.getElementsByTagName('link');
      for (var i = lnks.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
      if (lnks[i].getAttribute('rel').indexOf('style')> -1 && lnks[i].getAttribute('title')) {
      lnks[i].disabled = true;
      if (lnks[i].getAttribute('title') == thafuck()) lnks[i].disabled = false;
      }}}

      function thafuck() { return colors[Math.floor(Math.random() * colors.length)] }

    <div class="hilussssssm">
    <h1><span onclick="changeStyle()">Hanna</span></h1>
    <p>Click the perfect name. Don't say "but there is no perfect name on this page."</p>
    <p> And yes, clicking it is an admission that it is in fact perfect. 'cause it is.</p>
    <p><small>And whenever you're done, view page source.</small></p>
